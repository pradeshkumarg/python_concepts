# Python Concepts

 This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that I've created to practice and understand various Python concepts.

## Topics Covered

- **Classes and Objects**: Scripts related to object-oriented programming concepts, including class definitions, inheritance, and object instantiation.
- **Comprehensions**: Scripts demonstrating the use of list, set, and dictionary comprehensions for concise data manipulation.
- **Decorators**: Scripts illustrating the use of decorators to modify or extend the behavior of functions.
- **Exception Handling**: Scripts showcasing error handling techniques using try-except blocks and user-defined exceptions.
- **File Handling**: Scripts demonstrating file input/output operations, including reading from and writing to files.
- **Generators**: Scripts demonstrating the creation and usage of generator functions for efficient iteration over large datasets.
- **Multiprocessing**: Scripts exploring parallel processing using the multiprocessing module for improved performance.
- **Multithreading**: Scripts demonstrating multithreading concepts for concurrent execution of tasks.
- **Basics**: Scripts covering fundamental Python concepts such as functions, loops, iterators, sets, and command-line argument parsing.

## Usage

Feel free to explore each directory to dive into different Python topics. Each script is well-commented and serves as a learning resource to understand Python concepts better.
